When downloading mods from [Nexus Mods](https://nexusmods.com), you have to manually click on a download button every time a new mod is added to the queue.
Since modlists supported by tools like [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org) and [Portmod](https://gitlab.com/portmod/portmod) often have tens or hundreds of mods, this can be very time consuming.
Nexus AutoDL is an autoclicker (a.k.a., autodownloader, bot) that helps automate this process for you.
Specifically, while Nexus AutoDL is running, any time a [mod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsiad/nexus-autodl/master/assets/mod_download_page.jpg) or [collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsiad/nexus-autodl/master/assets/vortex_download_page.jpg) download page is visible on your screen, Nexus AutoDL will attempt to click the download button.

If you like Nexus AutoDL, please leave a star on GitHub to help others find it.

## Download

A Windows binary is available on the [releases page](https://github.com/parsiad/nexus-autodl/releases).
Download it and double-click on it to start Nexus AutoDL.
The first time you run the application, you will be presented with some instructions.
Follow the instructions and relaunch it.
This spawns a terminal window which you can close when you are done downloading mods.

Users on other platforms can download the source code on GitHub.

## Caution
