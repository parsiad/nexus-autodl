When downloading mods from [Nexus Mods](https://nexusmods.com), you have to manually click on a download button every time a new mod is added to the queue.
Since modlists supported by tools like [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org) and [Portmod](https://gitlab.com/portmod/portmod) often have tens or hundreds of mods, this can be very time consuming.
Nexus AutoDL is an autoclicker (a.k.a., autodownloader, bot) that helps automate this process for you.
Specifically, while Nexus AutoDL is running, any time a [mod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsiad/nexus-autodl/master/assets/mod_download_page.jpg) or [collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsiad/nexus-autodl/master/assets/collection_download_page.jpg) download page is visible on your screen, Nexus AutoDL will attempt to click the download button.
